        <ul>
          <li>First, check what Git branch you are on using command: git status</li>
          <li>If you are not on your main branch, navigate to it using command: git checkout main</li>
          <li>Now, from the main branch you want to edit, create a new feature branch using command: git checkout -b feature/feature-name</li>
          <li>From GitBash, navigate to VS Code using command: code .</li>
          <li>Add your updates to the appropriate file</li>
          <li>Next, add your changes to the repository using command: git add -A (NOTE: -A will add all changes made)</li>
          <li>Next, commit the changes using command: git commit -m "add a description for what was added here"</li>
          <li>Now make sure the current branch is up to date before opening a pull request using command: git pull origin main</li>
          <li>Next, push all changes made to your repository using command: git push origin branch name</li>
          <li>Navigate to your repository on GitHub and click on the "Pull Requests" tab and then click the "New pull request" button</li>
          <li>Ensure your base branch is set to main and your compare branch is set to whatever branch you just updated and want to add to your main branch</li>
          <li>Click on the "Create pull request" button</li>
          <li>Add a title and brief description of the changes made for the pull request</li>
          <li>If working in a group, at this point you would assign one or two co-workers to review the pull request before merging with the main branch. If working by yourself, you can merge the request without this step</li>
          <li>Merge your newly updated branch to your main branch by selecting the "Merge Pull Request" button and then confirming the merge request</li>
          <li>If the merge was successful, delete the compare branch</li>
          <li>If you had an issue open for the newly merged branch, navigate to the "Issues" tab and close the issue</li>
          <li>Navigate back to GitBash and update your local main branch using command: git checkout main</li>
          <li>Then pull the remote main branch from your GitHub repository to your local machine's main branch using command: git pull origin main</li>
